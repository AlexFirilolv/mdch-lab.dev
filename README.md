# Welcome to mdch-lab! üè†

**The Ultimate Raspberry Pi Kubernetes Cluster**

This repository hosts all the code, configurations, and features of my Raspberry Pi Kubernetes homelab. The primary goal of this project is to gain hands-on experience and deepen my knowledge of Kubernetes by building, securing, and optimizing a fully functional cluster.

## Current Areas of Focus

I'm actively learning and implementing:

- **Kubernetes & K3s** for efficient container orchestration on Raspberry Pi hardware.
- **Cilium** as the Container Network Interface (CNI) for enhanced network security and observability.
- **Cert-manager** for automated TLS certificate management.
- **Prometheus, Grafana & Loki** for robust monitoring, logging, and observability.
- **FluxCD** for continuous delivery, maintaining GitOps principles.
- **Apps and Services** like Pi-hole, Vaultwarden, Plex, and more ‚Äî configured to run seamlessly and securely within the cluster.

## Project Goals

- Follow Kubernetes best practices, ensuring the cluster is secure, reliable, and scalable.
- Gain valuable real-world experience relevant to DevOps and Kubernetes operations.
- Document and reflect the evolving state and progress of my homelab clearly and transparently.

Feel free to explore, suggest improvements, or collaborate!
